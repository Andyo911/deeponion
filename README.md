DeepOnion (ONION) :rocket:
=====================================

DeepOnion (ONION) is an anonymous cryptocurrency that is untraceable. All transactions are private and sent through the TOR network.

The integration with TOR ensures that users are always in a secured environment. There is no client-side configuration needed. The client will automatically join the TOR network and connect to the available TOR nodes in the network (including our seed nodes). After you connect to the DeepOnion network, you may check your displayed IP using DeepOnion client console, where you will see that your client is assigned a hidden TOR address (.onion address).
